# 🌾 Global Food Security Trend Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This is the interactive frontend component for a Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (DPEDA) project focused on global hunger and food security metrics.

The dashboard allows users to dynamically visualize and compare key indicators—such as **Undernourishment Rate**, **Calorie Supply**, and **Stunting Rate**—between any two countries over time.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Interactive Comparison:** Users can select two different countries and one metric to instantly compare trends on a single time-series chart.
* **Smooth Transitions:** Charts update with `easeInOutQuad` animations, providing a professional and seamless user experience.
* **Bright & Black Theme:** Features a high-contrast, dark-mode aesthetic inspired by modern terminal interfaces (electric cyan and magenta accents on a pure black background).
* **Real Data:** All visualizations are powered by processed data from the project's included CSV file.
